                The map displays the locations of victims in the October 7 attack, until Oct 9th. Kidnapping locations
                are marked in blue. Murder, death in combat, friendly fire incidents, accidental deaths, or kidnappings
                that ended in murder on the same day - are marked in red. You can select information layers and
                backgrounds in the right corner of the map.<br>. <a href="https://oct7database.com/locations_en"

                <strong>Important Details</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The locations represent where people were kidnapped or injured, but not necessarily where they
                        died. The data is based on testimony from family members as reported in the media and social
                        networks, eyewitnesses, and geolocation from open sources. We also received information from the
                        police regarding Nova Festival victims, as provided to Nova families and to <a
                            href='https://oct7map.com' target="_blank">oct7map</a>.</li>

                    <li><strong>Nova Festival Area:</strong> Exact locations for 19 murdered victims and one kidnapped
                        individual, Moran Stela Yanai, could not be determined. The names of the murdered are: Asaf
                        Mordechai Adberg, Ido Adari, Eden Liz Ohion, Yochai Azulai, Eliyahu Elya Ilooz, Stav Barzani,
                        Liliya Gorbicz-Vasilkovsky, Michael Vaknin, Yechezkel Hanum Cohen, Katerina Tabgan Goldman, Ilan
                        Lipovsky, Amit Maganazi, Yosef Shachar Medar, Amitai Malihi Ratzabi, Shlomi Shlomo Sabedia, Idan
                        Adari, Noam Elimelech Rotenberg, Dvir Rahamim, Tomer Moshe Sagiv.</li>

                    <li>In some cases the location is approximate, or the general location is known (e.g., Mefalsim
                        bypass) but not the exact spot.</li>

                    <li><strong>Gaza Envelope Communities:</strong> For some victims murdered or kidnapped in their
                        homes, only the neighborhood location is shown (in a pink frame), as exact addresses were not
                        published in the media. We have these locations stored. For others, the exact location appears,
                        along with a link to media coverage.</li>
