        <h2>Public Database of the October 7 Events and Iron Swords War</h2>
        <h4>
            This database includes information about those murdered, fallen, and kidnapped on October 7, 2023, and in the following war. It includes details such as age and place of residence, and more importantly, the location and nature of the incident—whether it was a battlefield death, murder, abduction, or injury leading to death. If the death occurred in a different location, that is also recorded.
            The information was voluntarily collected by civilians to provide the public with a single accurate and comprehensive source about the disaster.
        </h4>
        The data table is available as a 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OkULZJGPRnQFSr2MkYEPS54bXj9Rr91TEmTnAIRhsJU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheet</a>,
        and is also accessible as a  
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuval-harpaz/alarms/refs/heads/master/data/oct7database.csv" target="_blank">CSV file</a>
        on GitHub. The data is based on open sources, including interviews and media reports, and has been reviewed and cross-checked. Names were verified where possible against official memorial sites (IDF, National Insurance Institute, Police). Additional data was gathered from social media and directly from families who wished to share or correct information.
        <br>
        This entire project was done voluntarily by concerned citizens. Our goal is to document the crimes, commemorate the victims, and avoid errors, contradictory reports, or fake information. In some cases, there is no accurate information due to lack of documentation during the event or the discovery of the body. However, almost every case includes at least the approximate location of the incident. If you have information that can improve the database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@oct7database.com">info@oct7database.com</a>.
        <br>
        The map showing the names of victims is available in the “Materials & Information” section above.
